Post-processing code for experimental data (gamma spectrum from HPGe detector)
Produces detector efficiency curve
Reads in Gamma Spec fitted areas and removes background and callibrates given the callibration curve.

Note: A-D represent different levels of irradiation with:
A = 0 dose
B = 10 krad
C = 100 krad
D = 1 Mrad
