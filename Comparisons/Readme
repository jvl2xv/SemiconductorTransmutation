Python code to:
1. Post-process simulation output files (GEANT4 and FISPACTII)
2. Compare and graph results of each

FISPACT-II:
- All post-processing files have the same format and read directly from the main FISPACT-II output file (here titled runFile_SEMICONDUCTORNAME.out)
- They are structured to read all semiconductor files from a folder with the folder being specific to each irradiation scenario (ex. input radiation spectrum or orbit)
- Produces a graph of impurity concentrations

GEANT4:
- Reads in the GEANT4 output file (structured as a print of all non-protons tracked along with their event number and time of creation)
- Records all impurity elements in existance at a given time
- Produces a graph of impurity concentrations
